    "about": "\"Observer by habit, Designer by nature.\" That's me in a nutshell!\n\nI'm absolutely passionate about anything that connects with life - from everyday objects and products we use and buy, to advertising that inspires, marketing that creates moments, writing that tells a captivating story, and emotions that tie all of this together.\n\nI see the world from a different perspective and love to explore it from different angles. I don't just scratch the surface - I immerse myself in the design philosophies that make everything tick, and it's absolutely fascinating to me!",
