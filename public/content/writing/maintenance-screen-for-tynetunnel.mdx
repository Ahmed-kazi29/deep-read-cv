title: Crafting the Perfect Maintenance Screen
description: By Rishi Shah

The client for the [Tyne Tunnels](https://www.tt2.co.uk/) app wanted to develop a maintenance screen that would temporarily prevent users from accessing the app during downtimes, similar to maintenance screens used by banking apps.

As a UX designer, I started this project by asking key questions to understand the core needs and goals for this maintenance screen:

1. What is the purpose and reason for the maintenance screen?

2. What exact messaging does the client want to display to users?

3. Will there be a way for users to take action, like contacting support?

4. Are we given an exact or approximate date and time for the maintenance duration?

5. How will users be notified when the app is back up after maintenance?

With these needs clarified, I could start designing screens that would provide users with clarity around why the screen appears, how long maintenance will take, and how they'll know when the app is back up.

## My ideal user goals

- Understand why they can't currently access the app's features

- See clear messaging about the duration of downtime

- Have awareness about when they'll be able to use the app again

I created a user journey map and initial screen designs focused on meeting these goals. Key screens included:

- A prominent maintenance message explaining the purpose

- Date and approximate time, which show approximate maintenance duration

- Create certain indications that inform the user when the app is ready to be accessed.

By starting with strategic questioning, I uncovered the true UX needs for an intuitive maintenance screen that provides clarity to users throughout the process.
