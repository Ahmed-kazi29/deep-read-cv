## Objective

JobSquare was launched during the COVID-19 pandemic to help job seekers find employment opportunities. Despite being a relatively new player in the job portal industry, the platform gained significant traction due to the high demand for jobs during the pandemic. However, the company identified a significant challenge faced by recruiters, such as difficulty in finding relevant profiles, managing and tracking candidate status, and issues related to mobile accessibility, usability, and branding. As a designer, my objective is to address these challenges by identifying key areas for improvement, analyzing the funnel and user journeys, reducing the churn rate, and improving the design delivery process.

## Role and Responsibility

- Conduct a design audit to identify current problems and user behavior on the app

- Enhance overall brand presence to encourage users to explore the product

- Develop a design system that aligns with company and user objectives
