title: Crafting an Intuitive In-App Purchase Flow
description: By Rishi Shah
---

I was tasked with designing the in-app purchase flow for a mobile scanning app. The client provided a rough flowchart of their desired requirements and outcomes. My goal was crafting an experience that reduced user confusion and friction.

- Client was Socket Mobile, who make barcode scanning devices

- They wanted to add in-app purchases to their mobile app to enable subscriptions for scanner features

- This was new functionality not in the current app

- Client provided a rough flowchart of desired user flow

- My role was to design an intuitive, user-centric purchase process

## Research and Discovery

I started by asking numerous questions to understand the broader context and user goals:

- I started by asking questions to understand contexts and pain points:
  - Do subscriptions work for both scanner devices or just in-app?

  - How does activation work without requiring login?

  - Impacts of removing device while subscribed?

  - Any license ID needs?

  - Benefits of subscribing vs not?

  - Competitor landscape for devices/apps?

  - Accessing subscription history and invoices?

- Clarified unknowns through brainstorming exercises and discussions with stakeholders

- Goal was aligning business goals with minimizing user confusion

Brainstorming exercises and discussions clarified uncertainties and aligned business and user needs.

- Rapidly sketched concepts for different scenarios and use cases

- Created lo-fi wireframes to test core user flows

- Iterated on feedback from users and client collaboratively

- Focused on ease of use but allowing flexibility in journey

- Wrote supportive copy to provide clarity and build trust

- Designed for visual consistency with brand style

- Validated concepts through live prototyping

1. Added option to skip app update prompt if unnecessary for current use case. This avoided forcing users to update if they only needed base app features. Gave flexibility.

2. Consolidated license validation into one logical screen rather than two screens suggested by client. Checked both local and server status in one place to simplify process. Prevented extra steps.

3. Designed clear and actionable messaging for handling errors during license check. Guided users to either retry or contact support rather than just show failure. Enabled easy recovery.

4. Combined license authorization and confirmation of successful purchase into one streamlined screen. Prevented extra context switching between steps. Smooth flow.

5. For payment failures, provided friendly guidance and a visible Retry button encouraging users to attempt purchase again. Avoided abandonment.

By deeply understanding contexts and goals, I delivered an optimized purchase experience that exceeded initial expectations. The intuitive flow reduced abandonment while retaining flexibility.
